            <h4>The name of this project is "Waterbike". It was created by Ivan Henriques.</h4> 
            <h4>Ivan Henriques is a transdisciplinary artist and researcher working in multimedia installations examining living systems. He explores in his works hybrids of nature and technological culture creating new forms of communication between humans and other living organisms. He considers nature as an inspiration and a necessary factor in the development of the technological world.</h4>

            The waterbike is an interactive floating kinetic sculpture. It used human energy to pump water through a purifying hydraulic system. This purifying hydraulic system consists of a spiral pump connected with tubes in which bacteria are living. Organic materials are then fed to these bacteria. This will cause the water environment to be purified. The waterbike invites people to interact with the machine’s operating system. This creates the possibility for people to act in a playful and conscious relationship with the machine.  
          </p>
          <p>
            This project was motivated by the experiences of the artist in the Netherlands and Brazil. He witnessed the conditions of Rio de Janeiro State lagoon’s system, composed of small and large ponds in Rio, and Rotterdam’s harbor, which consists of canals and ponds. These two were absolutely polluted.

            This project is an example of using exertion gaming for a good cause and that is something that I really appreciate. If this project is successful, you would only need people to replenish the conditions of the environment. There would be countless possibilities of how you could use this project. 
          </p>

          <p>
            You could adapt the project where people could even make a competition out of it. You could have waterbike races where various people are racing while they are cleaning the water. It could also be used as transportation in lakes where people can travel from point A to point B while cleaning the water.

            On the excursion it self, I wasn't a huge fan of it. I was expecting a more technological expo but it wasn't meant to be. What I did learn though is that you don't need to go all out to make an interesting concept. All you need is an idea and the rest will come to you. And I think that is the most valuable lesson I could get from this excursion.

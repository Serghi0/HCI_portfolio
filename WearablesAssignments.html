      <p>
        The concept is based on social anxiety. Social anxiety is the fear of social situations that involve interaction with other people. You could say social anxiety is the fear and anxiety of being negatively judged and evaluated by other people. It is a pervasive disorder and causes anxiety and fear in most all areas of a person's life.  
      </p>
      <p>
        For this concept the user could be wearing a watch that would indicate if there are too many people around the user. That way the user will know if there are allot of people in the vicinity and that way the user can make sure that his panic attack doesnâ€™t flare up. Since social anxiety tends to flare up when there are allot of people in close vicinity of you, the distance in which the wearable will notify you will be from 50 centimeters to about four meters. 
      </p>
      <p>
        The wearable will use a proximity sensor to detect people in the radius described above. It will measure how close the people are to the user and it will also measure how many people are in the vicinity. This would be very useful to the user. The system could indicate on the watch monitor how many people there are and how close they are to the user.
      </p>
      <p>
        The system could even give the user daily tips on how to combat his social anxiety. That way it will be a multifunctional system to combat social anxiety. It would help the user prevent getting a panic attack and it would give the user tips on how to lessen their social anxiety.
      </p>
      <p>
        The wearable would be a watch with a user-friendly interface. The watch would give a headcount of how many people there are and how far the nearest person is from the user. The user would receive notifications if the wearable detects a large amount of people or if the wearable would have a daily tip.

            <h1 class="titleR">Reflection on the labweeks and product.</h1>
            <div class="textSection">
              <p>I am very content with my product. At first, I wasn’t sure if it was possible to make this product due to limitations with the sensor and not a lot of people in my group having experience with programming but with a lot of hard work it was possible and that makes it even more satisfactory. We had set out to make the best product we could make, and we exceeded our expectations by making a game that allot of people enjoyed playing.</p>
              <p>The quality of the product was pretty good. The animations made were pretty original and were made in a way that all ages could appreciate it. The code was pretty advanced and combined different libraries to produce something special. There were limitations in the product though. The sensor wasn’t the strongest. Because of this there were occasions were the sensor wouldn’t detect the ball where the score wouldn’t be counted. Or if the ball hit the board or the basket too hard, the sensor would pick up the vibrations. This would cause the score to be counted up while it didn’t need to happen.</p> 
              <p>The process had its ups and downs but there were more days that I thought that work got done than days where it felt like nothing was done. All in all, the process making the product went well. Each day something new was added to the code and lessons were learned.</p> 
              <p>Even though I was only a helper on the first few days due to a broken laptop, I picked up the slack when I had a new laptop. Although someone else started with the processing code, I had completely changed it to work the way we needed it to. I had also gone out and bought tools and products we needed for our project. I also worked from home to make sure we didn’t have to rush at school to get a working product. The workload wasn’t always divided equally throughout the group where I had to ask myself sometimes if some of the members were even doing anything useful for the product. There were others who did their part like working on the Arduino code or the animations, but there were others who didn’t do allot of work. But in the end, we did finish the product.</p>
              <p>I spent my time doing various things. I spent most of my time working on the processing code. While I wasn’t doing that, I was helping one of the others with what they were doing. To be honest I should have taken more breaks because the frustrations were giving me massive headaches. </p>
              <p>I was certainly motivated during these two weeks. It was very fun to be able to do things via code that I wasn’t able to in the past. Due to this I had exceeded my expectations for these two weeks. I had learned quite allot about processing and coding in general which was fun. I had learned allot because I had to figure out things all by myself to make sure the code works. That made sure that I would understand why I made the decisions I made instead of having someone else making the decisions for me. I had also learned a bit about working with people I normally don’t work with. Personality clashes aren’t fun but if you want to get the job done you should bite the bullet and work. </p>
              <p>All in all, the labweeks were fun yet stressful.  </p>

              <p>This was the start of the HCI Lab Weeks.</p>
              <p>Before we started with the lab weeks we had to listed to a briefing from Chris Heydra. He explained the ins-and-outs of the lab weeks, the expectations, the challenges and things of that nature. Afterwards we were sent to the backroom to see which topic we were assigned to and to which group we were assigned to. Exciting times.</p> 
              <p>I was assigned to exertion gaming even though wearable technology was my first choice. Nonetheless, I will still make the best of it and make the best product I can.</p> 
              <p>I was assigned a group for the coming two weeks which consisted of Sarafina, Dion, Mike, Zuhal and myself. A pretty diverse cast if I may say so myself. First of all, we started introducing ourselves and telling each other which classes we were from. Secondly, we announced what our specialties were so that we could kind of see which group member would be doing which task.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="textSection2">
              <p>Afterwards we decided to brainstorm on what kind of concept we wanted to make. We had a 30 minute to an hour session of brainstorming. My brainchild was a ping pong game where you didn’t need to use a ball to play the game. The ball was projected onto the table and sensors would detect if you had hit the ball or not and at what speed. Therefor you wouldn’t have the trouble of having the ball flying away from you.</p>
              <p>In the end we decided on the concept of Dion, an exertion game involving a basketball. The concept evolved from just dribbling the ball for points to scoring the ball for points. The concept would be that there would be three mini baskets, each containing lights. The point of the game was to be able to score before the time runs out at the basket. Thus, we decided on the name “beat the light” for the product.</p>
              <p>When the day ended, I went and bought some product that we needed for the product. This included spraypaint and LED light strips. </p>

          <h1 class="title">Day 2</h1>
          <div class="textSection1">
            <p>On the second day of HCI Lab Weeks my laptop gave to me, a broken charging port meaning I could not work on my own. Due to this unfortunate incident, I was forced to be a helping hand for the other group members for the time being.</p>
            <p>Even though I had my misfortunes, the first steps of the creation of the product was still under way. We received a proximity sensor which we could couple to an Arduino. With this sensor we could detect if the ball got in the basket or not. Mike started figuring out how to code this in the Arduino.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="textSection2"> 
            <p>We decided to also visualize how the player would be able to keep score. We changed the concept a bit where there would be a projection of the score. Dion and I started on the code for this in the program processing while Dion and Sarafina started with the animations in photoshop.</p> 
            <p>During the day Sarafina and I also went to get a mini basket for the project. The group decided that these baskets were to small and we needed a bigger basket to accomplish our goal. The concept was tweaked a bit as well where the player only had one basket to shoot at and different posts containing light to shoot from. </p>

          <div class="textSection1">
            <p>On the third day of HCI Lab Weeks my laptop gave to me, still a broken charging port meaning I could not work on my own. Due to this very unfortunate incident, I was still forced to be a helping hand for the other group members for the time being. </p>
            <p>Due to the group deciding to forego the mini baskets, Zuhal and I went to return the mini baskets and get a bigger basket for our product. Even though this basket was the perfect size for the concept, it was on the expensive side. So, we returned it later that day. I did manage to get a basket from a classmate of mine who would bring it for us the next day.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="textSection2">           
            <p>The Arduino code was getting up to scratch. The proximity wherein the sensor had to detect the ball had been set. On the processing side of things, Dion and I figured out how to connect the Arduino to the processing program. That way we could let processing convert the data received to a visual point counter. </p> 
            <p>The product was tweaked a bit where the player had two minutes to shoot as many baskets as he could. To visualize this, we went to get a timer code and to visualize this, Dion made different animations to visualize the “beat the light” concept we were going for.</p>

          <h1 class="title">Day 4</h1>
          <div class="textSection1">        
            <p>On the fourth day of HCI Lab Weeks my laptop gave to me, a brand-new MacBook pro. Meaning, I could go and work on my own.</p>
            <p>To maximize our efforts, Dion and I split up the visualization task where I was working on the coding while he was working on the graphics. </p> 
            <p>We went for a visual where there was a basket court in the background of a scoreboard. There would be an animated bird flying to and from during the day and sundown. Afterwards there would be a moonrise. It was Dion’s task to fine tune the visuals while it was my task to code the changing of scenery.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="textSection2">           
            <p>The Arduino code that Mike developed was used to see if it could be coupled to the processing program. I was tasked with that task and it succeeded. We also tested Madmapper without the animation to see where the ideal place would be to place our product.</p>
            <p>While all this was going on, the rest of the group was doing research on how to make the light posts at a cost-efficient way.</p> 
            <p>I had also received the basket from the classmate. The group was pleased.</p>
            <p>After the workday ended, I finetuned the processing code at home where the different phases of the game would show depending on the in-game time. </p>

          <div class="textSection1">          
            <p>Day 5 was a very frustrating day to be honest. </p>
            <p>I realized that there was a delay before the processing animation would commence. I could not figure out why this was happening, so I asked a teacher for help. The teacher gave advice, but he also rewrote the code. This caused the code not to work the way it was supposed to. Instead of rectifying his mistake he just said, “at least your code looks nicer”. </p> 
            <p>Due to this, I had to redo the whole code from the ground up. Thankfully I had an older version of the code on my laptop where I could compare codes and redo the whole thing.</p> 
          </div>
          <div class="textSection2">          
            <p>While all this was happening, we received a guest lecture about artificial creatures. To be honest I wasn’t really paying much attention. I just wanted to get the code redone.</p>
            <p>At the end of the day, it felt like we made one step forward and two steps back. The teacher also said that due to the animations we used weren’t original content, that it wouldn’t really stand out. Therefor a whole new batch of animations had to be made.</p> 
            <p>Thankfully there was the weekend. In the weekend I decided to redo the whole code and improve on it. I redid the whole code where the whole phases would appear. There would be a “get ready” page to compensate for the delay. The switching between the scenes also went seamlessly. </p>

          <div class="textSection1">          
            <p>For the concept the animation had to be changed. During the day, Dion was creating a whole new animation. It changed from a scoreboard where there would be a basketball court in the background with a flying bird to an original made basketball court where a basketball player would be scoring baskets. </p>
          </div>
          <div class="textSection2">          
            <p>While Dion was creating this animation, I was implementing this into the code. The code had to be tweaked because it wasn’t going to be about different phases of the day but about the scoring of the basket itself. By the end of the day the objective was to make the digital player score at the same time the real player scored. This was proving to be quite difficult. The digital player would score when the sensor would go off, but it would stop at random times when testing. I couldn’t figure out a way to fix this yet. The group also couldn’t. Even the teachers that were asked, couldn’t figure out a way to make it work efficiently.  </p>

          <p>This was the day of the excursion. The day we were all waiting for.</p>
          <p>Before the excursion we made the finish touches to the product, adding the last animations. We then put everything in place for the expo.</p> 
          <p>After having an early dinner with the group, we went to our posts and got ready for the people. There were allot of people coming to our post. From the elderly to the younglings. Everybody was enjoying our product.</p> 
          <p>I was working the laptop to make sure the game would go seamlessly. At the end of the day, it was a huge success. Allot of people told us they enjoyed our product. Chris Heydra even told us that our product was chosen to showcase at the sport campus at Zuiderpark.</p>
